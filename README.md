Use WASD to move the camera around the map

minus and plus keys will zoom the camera in and out

selecting on a unit will show its menu

selecting on a unit again will deselect it

clicking the move option will allow you to click a tile to set as its target

if you change your mind, click move again

if units overlap, select them individually using the arrow keys

units cannot navigate over water or mountains

Enjoy!
